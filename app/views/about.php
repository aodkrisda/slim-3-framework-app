			<h1>So let's begin!</h1>
			<p>I was born on 2nd August 1984, and since I was a kid I developed strong interest
				in technical things. I was - and I still am - curious about how things are working.
			</p></br>
			<p>But one moment changed everything. It was the day when my Dad brought to me brand new
				Commodore 64 when he came from a bussiness trip from Switzerland. Magic happened.
				Although the manual was on German that didn't stop me from leafing throught it.
				Shortly, I started typing small and not so small stippets it had in it. I was so 
				determined in doing that that my parents even forbid me to "play" with it for a year.
				I was frantic.</p></br>
			<p>Long story short, after elementary school love for informatics led me into signing to
			electrical engineering school, and I decided to become electrical technician for computers,
			but I was more looking forward programming rather then anything else, but due to a lack of equipment
			with which school had to deal with I didn't get what I expected. Soon attending that school became a nightmare.
		</p></br>
		<p>Because I was little bit rebelous I've started looking for a kind of activities where I could
			channel creativity. In that period I found at that time my second favourite thing - drumms! I've began
		    practicing drumms vigorously and after a year or so I formed a band with couple of my friends and we had
		    five great years of exploring our minds and instruments.</p></br>
		<p>Since I wasn't satisfied with the knowledge and opportunities I got during my highschool education and state of society in general, and because
			of affinities I had toward philosophy and sociology I've chosen to sign into Faculty of Philosophy at University in Belgrade, department for Sociology.
			It was next logical move. To try to help to make the world a better place. How naive was to think that way? :)</p></br>
		<p>After five years of studying I've put an end to the career of sociologist.</p></br>
		<p class="lead">But through all that time one thing remaind constant. It was programming and posibility of making some sort of software systems.</p></br>
		<p>Here and there through all that time a ran over some manual on programming and I've always found myself wandering off while I was 
			searching for some topic involving some issue I was interested in. What a heck! I decided to make my hobby a profession.</p></br>
		<p>After I attended a one year programme at ITAcademy I eqiped myself with minimal proof of my programming skills. I know what you think.
			Let's be straight. It's a good marketing first and foremost. Attending it only gave me a structured way of acquiring knowledge. But
			already at begining of it I saw that my level of knowledge was a level higher and that I was good at it.</p></br>
		<p>I hold a PHP Web Developer certificate from ITAcademy and during last year and a half I became aware of modern 
			programming standards, and solely by my effort I acquired all relevant insights into the requirements of a modern web developer and building the
			good workflow. I am constantly developing my skills and learning new stuff and lately I am searching for a possition in some software company which
			I hope I will find where I could be part of a team and be able to learn from and work with renown profesionals.</p>
